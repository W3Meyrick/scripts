### Stress and Performance Testing Assessment for Google Cloud Directory Sync (GCDS)

#### Introduction
This document outlines the stress testing assessment for Google Cloud Directory Sync (GCDS) running on Google Compute Engine. It provides necessary details to evaluate the requirement for stress testing and identifies critical use cases to be considered. 

#### Objective
The objective of this assessment is to determine if stress testing is required for GCDS. It includes identifying any specific stress conditions, suggesting the best approach for testing if necessary, and providing a rationale for the final assessment outcome.

#### Application Functionality and Business Processes Supported
GCDS synchronizes users, groups, and other directory data from an on-premises Active Directory (AD) or LDAP server to Google Workspace. This ensures that the directory information is consistent across both environments.

| Functionality              | Description                                                          |
|----------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| User Sync                  | Synchronizes user accounts from AD/LDAP to Google Workspace.         |
| Group Sync                 | Synchronizes group memberships from AD/LDAP to Google Workspace.     |
| Organizational Units Sync  | Synchronizes organizational units from AD/LDAP to Google Workspace.  |
| Password Sync              | Ensures user passwords are consistent across AD/LDAP and Google Workspace. |

#### Key Business Use Cases
| Use Case                | Description                                                                 |
|-------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| New Employee Onboarding | Automatic creation of new user accounts in Google Workspace based on AD data.|
| Employee Termination    | Automatic deactivation or deletion of user accounts in Google Workspace when employees leave the organization. |
| Group Management        | Synchronization of group memberships to ensure correct access permissions and email distribution lists. |
| Organizational Changes  | Reflecting changes in organizational structure promptly in Google Workspace. |

#### Application Workload Volumes
| Workload Metric         | Example Volume in a Large Enterprise  |
|-------------------------|---------------------------------------|
| Number of Users         | 50,000+                               |
| Number of Groups        | 10,000+                               |
| Sync Frequency          | Every 15 minutes                      |
| Data Changes per Sync   | Approximately 500-1000 changes        |

#### Production System Capacity and Utilization
| Metric                  | Capacity                     | Current Utilization         |
|-------------------------|------------------------------|-----------------------------|
| CPU Usage               | 32 vCPUs                     | 10-20% during sync periods  |
| Memory Usage            | 128 GB RAM                   | 15-25% during sync periods  |
| Network Bandwidth       | 1 Gbps                       | 100-200 Mbps during sync periods |
| Disk I/O                | 5000 IOPS                    | 200-500 IOPS during sync periods |

#### Stress Testing Assessment Outcome
Based on the predictable workload for AD sync purposes and the inherent scalability of running GCDS on Google Compute Engine, stress testing is not required. The system's design to handle the specified volumes and its ability to scale dynamically in response to increased demand ensures that performance will remain stable even under peak load conditions. Consequently, GCDSâ€™s operational characteristics under the defined workloads are well-understood, eliminating the need for additional stress testing.
