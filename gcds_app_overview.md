### Application Overview for Google Cloud Directory Sync (GCDS) Running on GCP Compute Instances

#### Application Functionality
Google Cloud Directory Sync (GCDS) is a tool that synchronizes user data between on-premises Active Directory (AD) or LDAP servers and Google Workspace. It ensures that directory information is consistent across both environments by providing the following key functionalities:

- **User Sync**: Synchronizes user accounts from AD/LDAP to Google Workspace.
- **Group Sync**: Synchronizes group memberships from AD/LDAP to Google Workspace.
- **Organizational Units Sync**: Synchronizes organizational units from AD/LDAP to Google Workspace.
- **Password Sync**: Ensures user passwords are consistent across AD/LDAP and Google Workspace.
- **Contact Sync**: Synchronizes external contacts to Google Workspace.
- **Custom Attribute Sync**: Allows synchronization of custom attributes from AD/LDAP to Google Workspace.

#### Logical Architecture
The logical architecture of GCDS running on GCP Compute Instances can be described as follows:

1. **Client Layer**:
   - **Google Workspace**: Cloud-based productivity and collaboration tools where user, group, and organizational unit data is synchronized.
   - **On-Premises Directory Services**: AD/LDAP servers that hold the source directory data.

2. **Synchronization Layer**:
   - **GCDS Instances**: Multiple instances of GCDS running on GCP Compute Engine virtual machines, responsible for synchronizing data between AD/LDAP and Google Workspace.
   - **Data Transformations**: Processes within GCDS that map and transform AD/LDAP attributes to Google Workspace attributes.

3. **Management and Control Layer**:
   - **Jenkins**: CI/CD tool used to automate the deployment, configuration, and management of GCDS instances.
   - **Terraform**: Infrastructure as code (IaC) tool used to provision and manage the GCP infrastructure, including compute instances, networking, and security configurations.

#### Deployment Architecture
The deployment architecture for GCDS on GCP Compute Instances involves the following components and tools:

1. **Infrastructure Provisioning**:
   - **Terraform**:
     - **Infrastructure Definition**: Terraform scripts define the infrastructure resources required for the deployment, including GCP Compute Instances, VPC networks, subnets, firewall rules, and load balancers.
     - **Deployment**: Terraform is used to apply the configuration and provision the resources in GCP, ensuring a consistent and repeatable deployment process.

2. **Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)**:
   - **Jenkins**:
     - **Pipeline Configuration**: Jenkins pipelines are configured to automate the deployment process. This includes steps for pulling the latest GCDS configurations, building the deployment artifacts, and triggering Terraform to provision the infrastructure.
     - **Automated Testing**: Jenkins can run automated tests to verify the functionality and performance of GCDS instances before they are deployed to production.
     - **Deployment**: Once testing is complete, Jenkins pipelines deploy the GCDS instances to the provisioned GCP Compute Instances.

3. **Operational Management**:
   - **Monitoring and Logging**:
     - **Stackdriver**: Google Cloudâ€™s Stackdriver is used for monitoring and logging. It provides insights into the performance and health of the GCDS instances, alerting administrators to any issues that arise.
     - **Custom Dashboards**: Custom dashboards can be created in Stackdriver to visualize key metrics such as synchronization success rates, data transformation errors, and CPU/memory usage.
   - **Auto-Scaling**:
     - **Instance Groups**: GCDS instances can be deployed in managed instance groups that automatically scale based on synchronization load and other performance metrics.
   - **Security**:
     - **Firewall Rules**: Configured to restrict access to the GCDS instances, allowing only authorized systems to connect.
     - **IAM Policies**: Ensure that only authorized personnel have access to manage and configure the GCDS infrastructure.
