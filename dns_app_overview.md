### Application Overview for Unbound DNS Running on GCP Compute Instances

#### Application Functionality
Unbound DNS is a high-performance DNS resolver that provides the following key functionalities:

- **DNS Resolution**: Resolves DNS queries from clients, translating domain names into IP addresses.
- **DNS Caching**: Caches DNS query results to speed up subsequent queries, reducing latency and improving performance.
- **DNSSEC Validation**: Ensures DNS responses are authentic and unaltered by validating them using DNSSEC.
- **Rate Limiting**: Controls the rate of DNS queries to protect against abuse and attacks, ensuring the stability and reliability of DNS services.
- **IPv4 and IPv6 Support**: Fully supports both IPv4 and IPv6 protocols.
- **Access Control**: Allows administrators to define access control lists to restrict or allow DNS query access based on IP address or subnet.

#### Logical Architecture
The logical architecture of Unbound DNS running on GCP Compute Instances can be described as follows:

1. **Client Layer**:
   - **Clients**: Devices and applications (e.g., web browsers, email servers, internal applications) that generate DNS queries.

2. **DNS Resolver Layer**:
   - **Unbound DNS Instances**: Multiple instances of Unbound DNS running on GCP Compute Engine virtual machines, configured to handle and resolve DNS queries from clients.
   - **DNS Cache**: In-memory cache within each Unbound DNS instance that stores recently resolved DNS queries to expedite response times for future queries.

3. **DNS Root and Authoritative Servers**:
   - **Root DNS Servers**: The top-level DNS servers that provide information about the authoritative DNS servers for each top-level domain (TLD).
   - **Authoritative DNS Servers**: Servers that provide authoritative answers to DNS queries for specific domain names.

4. **Management and Control Layer**:
   - **Jenkins**: CI/CD tool used to automate the deployment and management of Unbound DNS instances.
   - **Terraform**: Infrastructure as code (IaC) tool used to provision and manage the GCP infrastructure, including compute instances, networking, and security configurations.

#### Deployment Architecture
The deployment architecture for Unbound DNS on GCP Compute Instances involves the following components and tools:

1. **Infrastructure Provisioning**:
   - **Terraform**: 
     - **Infrastructure Definition**: Terraform scripts define the infrastructure resources required for the deployment, including GCP Compute Instances, VPC networks, subnets, firewall rules, and load balancers.
     - **Deployment**: Terraform is used to apply the configuration and provision the resources in GCP, ensuring a consistent and repeatable deployment process.

2. **Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)**:
   - **Jenkins**:
     - **Pipeline Configuration**: Jenkins pipelines are configured to automate the deployment process. This includes steps for pulling the latest Unbound DNS configurations, building the deployment artifacts, and triggering Terraform to provision the infrastructure.
     - **Automated Testing**: Jenkins can run automated tests to verify the functionality and performance of Unbound DNS instances before they are deployed to production.
     - **Deployment**: Once testing is complete, Jenkins pipelines deploy the Unbound DNS instances to the provisioned GCP Compute Instances.

3. **Operational Management**:
   - **Monitoring and Logging**: 
     - **Stackdriver**: Google Cloudâ€™s Stackdriver is used for monitoring and logging. It provides insights into the performance and health of the Unbound DNS instances, alerting administrators to any issues that arise.
     - **Custom Dashboards**: Custom dashboards can be created in Stackdriver to visualize key metrics such as query rates, cache hit ratios, and CPU/memory usage.
   - **Auto-Scaling**: 
     - **Instance Groups**: Unbound DNS instances can be deployed in managed instance groups that automatically scale based on query load and other performance metrics.
   - **Security**:
     - **Firewall Rules**: Configured to restrict access to the Unbound DNS instances, allowing only authorized clients to send DNS queries.
     - **IAM Policies**: Ensure that only authorized personnel have access to manage and configure the DNS infrastructure.
