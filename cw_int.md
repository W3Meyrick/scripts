# GCP DevOps Engineer Interview – Focus on Cloud Workstations Control Plane

## 📌 Technical Interview Questions & Sample Good Answers

---

### 1. How would you architect a scalable and secure control plane on GCP to manage Cloud Workstations across multiple projects or regions?

**Good Answer:**

> I’d build the control plane using a centralized GCP project, with Cloud Run or GKE Autopilot for API management and orchestration. It would use Workstation APIs via service accounts with narrowly scoped IAM roles. To handle multi-project and regional management, I’d use Pub/Sub to fan out provisioning events and Cloud Tasks for rate control. For security, I'd use VPC Service Controls and org policies, and make all communication go through internal APIs protected by Identity-Aware Proxy or Cloud Endpoints.

### 2. Describe how you would automate the lifecycle (provisioning, updating, deleting) of Cloud Workstations using infrastructure-as-code tools. Which tool(s) would you use and why?

**Good Answer:**

> I’d use Terraform with the GCP provider since it's widely supported, modular, and easy to integrate into CI/CD. Each workstation or group of workstations would be defined as a Terraform module with variables for image, machine type, region, and network config. I'd set up pipelines with Cloud Build or GitHub Actions to apply changes in a controlled environment, with state stored in GCS using bucket-level locking to prevent drift. For dynamic provisioning, I might also include Cloud Functions that trigger Terraform based on events or API calls.

### 3. How would you implement monitoring, logging, and alerting for a control plane that manages Cloud Workstations?

**Good Answer:**

> I’d integrate Cloud Logging to capture audit logs and API responses for every workstation action. Cloud Monitoring would track API latency, error rates, and provisioning success/failure metrics. I’d define custom metrics in the control plane service, then set alerting policies using Cloud Monitoring to notify our team via Slack or email. For debugging, logs would be indexed with Log-based Metrics to help identify issues like provisioning failures or permission denials.

### 4. Discuss the role of Identity and Access Management (IAM) in a Cloud Workstations control plane. How would you ensure least privilege access?

**Good Answer:**

> IAM is central to securing the control plane. Each component would use a dedicated service account with only the required roles (e.g., `cloudworkstations.admin` for provisioning, `viewer` for auditing). End users would not have direct access to the API. Instead, they’d interact via a frontend that validates their identity and enforces policies. I’d enforce organization policies to prevent escalation (e.g., disabling Service Account Token Creator for non-admins), and periodically audit roles using `gcloud iam list-grantable-roles` and Policy Analyzer.

### 5. How would you test and validate that new workstation templates or configuration changes won't break downstream dependencies or workflows?

**Good Answer:**

> I'd implement a CI pipeline that runs integration tests for any change to workstation configs. This includes validating that startup scripts work, that the image includes all required dev tools, and that it boots within acceptable time. I’d use a test GCP project to spin up workstations from new templates, run health checks (e.g., ssh, IDE responsiveness), and then tear them down. If issues are found, changes are blocked from merging. I’d also tag templates with semantic versions and allow rollback.

### 6. Cloud Workstations use gRPC APIs under the hood. How would you troubleshoot connectivity or authorization issues when provisioning fails through the control plane?

**Good Answer:**

> First, I’d check the error returned by the gRPC call—most GCP APIs return clear codes like `PERMISSION_DENIED` or `RESOURCE_EXHAUSTED`. I’d inspect Cloud Audit Logs to see which identity made the request and which permissions were missing. If it’s a network issue, I’d verify that the control plane is using the correct Private Service Connect endpoints and that firewall rules allow traffic. I might also enable debug logging on the control plane service to capture request/response data (sanitized), then retry with exponential backoff if it’s transient.

## ➕ Optional Additions

Here are three additional enhancements you can consider for the interview process:

- ✅ **Behavioral Questions**: e.g., “Tell me about a time you dealt with a GCP production incident and how you handled it.”
- 🔍 **More Technical Depth**: Expand into topics like VPC peering, service mesh integration (e.g., Istio), or binary authorization in GKE.
- 📊 **Scoring Rubric**: Add a 1–5 rating scale per question, covering depth, accuracy, clarity, and practical experience.
