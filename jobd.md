## About the Role
We are seeking a **Lead Platform Engineer – Cloud Orchestration** to spearhead the delivery and evolution of our Kubernetes-based Internal Developer Platform (IDP). This platform serves as the foundation for our regulated industry (e.g., financial services, healthcare, or government), where compliance, resilience, and security are critical.

You will own the design, implementation, and operations of a controller-based orchestration layer that automates the provisioning, management, and scaling of platform services across multiple cloud environments. As a hands-on technical leader, you will guide a team of engineers, collaborate with stakeholders across security, compliance, and application delivery, and shape the future of developer experience in our organization.

## Key Responsibilities
- ✅ Lead the design and delivery of a Kubernetes platform leveraging the controller/operator pattern to manage IDP resources and workflows.
- ✅ Architect and implement cloud-native solutions that enable secure, compliant, and efficient self-service for product teams.
- ✅ Define and implement platform automation strategies including GitOps, CI/CD integration, infrastructure-as-code, and policy-as-code.
- ✅ Own the reliability, scalability, and maintainability of the platform, introducing best practices for observability, performance tuning, and cost optimization.
- ✅ Partner with InfoSec, compliance, and governance teams to ensure platform services meet stringent regulatory requirements (e.g., SOC2, PCI-DSS, HIPAA, GDPR).
- ✅ Mentor and guide a team of platform engineers, setting technical direction, reviewing designs, and fostering a culture of continuous improvement.
- ✅ Engage with internal stakeholders (developers, architects, product owners) to understand needs, prioritize features, and deliver platform capabilities that improve developer productivity and satisfaction.
