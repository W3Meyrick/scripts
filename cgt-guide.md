There are currently two branches—MAIN and ARTIFACTORY_MIGRATION—being treated as production within a critical Maven-based library. This creates risk across build pipelines, introduces ambiguity in artifact generation, and increases the potential for divergence between codebases. All consuming teams may be unsure which branch to align to, undermining stability and consistency across environments.

To resolve this, identify the correct long-term production branch—typically MAIN—and immediately stop treating both branches as authoritative. Merge or cherry-pick any essential changes from ARTIFACTORY_MIGRATION into MAIN, then lock ARTIFACTORY_MIGRATION as read-only or archive it with a clear deprecation notice. Update all pipelines and references to point to the single production branch. Enforce this structure via branch protection rules and CI policy to prevent future parallel-production states.
