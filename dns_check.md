### Stress and Performance Testing Assessment for Unbound DNS

#### Introduction
This document outlines the stress testing assessment for Unbound DNS running in a production environment. It provides necessary details to evaluate the requirement for stress testing and identifies critical use cases to be considered.

#### Objective
The objective of this assessment is to determine if stress testing is required for Unbound DNS. It includes identifying any specific stress conditions, suggesting the best approach for testing if necessary, and providing a rationale for the final assessment outcome.

#### Application Functionality and Business Processes Supported
Unbound DNS is a validating, recursive, and caching DNS resolver designed to provide high performance and security. It is used to resolve DNS queries and cache the results to improve the speed of subsequent requests.

| Functionality            | Description                                                                 |
|--------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| DNS Resolution           | Resolves DNS queries from clients.                                           |
| DNS Caching              | Caches DNS query results to speed up subsequent queries.                     |
| DNSSEC Validation        | Validates DNS responses for authenticity and integrity using DNSSEC.         |
| Rate Limiting            | Controls the rate of DNS queries to protect against abuse and attacks.       |

#### Key Business Use Cases
| Use Case                | Description                                                                 |
|-------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Web Browsing            | Resolving domain names for web browsers to access websites.                 |
| Email Services          | Resolving domain names for email servers to send and receive emails.        |
| Internal Applications   | Resolving domain names for internal applications and services.              |
| Security Validation     | Ensuring DNS responses are authentic and unaltered using DNSSEC.            |

#### Application Workload Volumes
| Workload Metric         | Example Volume in a Large Enterprise  |
|-------------------------|---------------------------------------|
| Number of Queries       | 1,000,000+ per day                    |
| Peak Queries per Second | 10,000+                               |
| Cache Hit Ratio         | 80-90%                                |
| DNSSEC Validations      | 500,000+ per day                      |

#### Production System Capacity and Utilization
| Metric                  | Capacity                     | Current Utilization         |
|-------------------------|------------------------------|-----------------------------|
| CPU Usage               | 16 vCPUs                     | 30-40% during peak periods  |
| Memory Usage            | 64 GB RAM                    | 40-50% during peak periods  |
| Network Bandwidth       | 1 Gbps                       | 200-300 Mbps during peak periods |
| Disk I/O                | 2000 IOPS                    | 100-200 IOPS during peak periods |

#### Stress Testing Assessment Outcome
Based on the predictable workload for DNS resolution purposes and the inherent scalability of Unbound DNS, stress testing is not required. Unbound DNS is designed to handle high query volumes efficiently, and its performance scales with additional resources. The system's operational characteristics under the defined workloads are well-understood, and its performance has been validated in numerous production environments. Consequently, stress testing for Unbound DNS is deemed unnecessary due to its robust design and proven scalability.
