### Application Overview for API Access Service (Squid Proxy) Running on GCP Compute Instances

#### Application Functionality
The API Access Service using Squid Proxy is designed to manage and control access to APIs by routing requests through a proxy server. Squid is a high-performance caching and forwarding web proxy that offers the following functionalities:

- **API Request Routing**: Routes API requests from clients to the appropriate backend services.
- **Caching**: Caches API responses to improve performance and reduce load on backend services.
- **Access Control**: Implements access control policies to manage which clients can access specific APIs.
- **Logging and Monitoring**: Provides detailed logs and monitoring capabilities for API requests and responses.
- **Load Balancing**: Distributes API requests across multiple backend servers to ensure efficient use of resources and high availability.
- **Security**: Enhances security by masking the backend infrastructure and filtering requests for threats.

#### Logical Architecture
The logical architecture of the Squid Proxy running on GCP Compute Instances includes the following components:

1. **Client Layer**:
   - **API Clients**: Applications or devices that send API requests to the proxy server.
   - **User Agents**: Different types of clients (e.g., browsers, mobile apps) making requests through the proxy.

2. **Proxy Layer**:
   - **Squid Proxy Instances**: Multiple instances of Squid Proxy running on GCP Compute Engine virtual machines, responsible for handling, routing, and caching API requests.
   - **Caching Mechanism**: Squid's built-in caching to store and serve frequently accessed API responses.

3. **Backend Services Layer**:
   - **API Servers**: Backend services that process API requests forwarded by the Squid Proxy.
   - **Load Balancer**: Distributes incoming API requests among multiple API servers to ensure load is balanced.

4. **Management and Control Layer**:
   - **Jenkins**: CI/CD tool used to automate the deployment, configuration, and management of Squid Proxy instances.
   - **Terraform**: Infrastructure as code (IaC) tool used to provision and manage the GCP infrastructure, including compute instances, networking, and security configurations.

#### Deployment Architecture
The deployment architecture for the Squid Proxy on GCP Compute Instances involves the following components and tools:

1. **Infrastructure Provisioning**:
   - **Terraform**:
     - **Infrastructure Definition**: Terraform scripts define the infrastructure resources required for the deployment, including GCP Compute Instances, VPC networks, subnets, firewall rules, and load balancers.
     - **Deployment**: Terraform is used to apply the configuration and provision the resources in GCP, ensuring a consistent and repeatable deployment process.

2. **Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)**:
   - **Jenkins**:
     - **Pipeline Configuration**: Jenkins pipelines are configured to automate the deployment process, including steps for pulling the latest Squid Proxy configurations, building the deployment artifacts, and triggering Terraform to provision the infrastructure.
     - **Automated Testing**: Jenkins can run automated tests to verify the functionality and performance of Squid Proxy instances before they are deployed to production.
     - **Deployment**: Once testing is complete, Jenkins pipelines deploy the Squid Proxy instances to the provisioned GCP Compute Instances.

3. **Operational Management**:
   - **Monitoring and Logging**:
     - **Stackdriver**: Google Cloudâ€™s Stackdriver is used for monitoring and logging. It provides insights into the performance and health of the Squid Proxy instances, alerting administrators to any issues that arise.
     - **Custom Dashboards**: Custom dashboards can be created in Stackdriver to visualize key metrics such as request rates, cache hit ratios, and CPU/memory usage.
   - **Auto-Scaling**:
     - **Instance Groups**: Squid Proxy instances can be deployed in managed instance groups that automatically scale based on request load and other performance metrics.
   - **Security**:
     - **Firewall Rules**: Configured to restrict access to the Squid Proxy instances, allowing only authorized systems to connect.
     - **IAM Policies**: Ensure that only authorized personnel have access to manage and configure the Squid Proxy infrastructure.
