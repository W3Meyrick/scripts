## Testing Strategy for a Cloud Platform Team in a Regulated Bank

### **Unit Testing**
- **Scope**: Focus on individual components like scripts, configurations, and modules for Squid, Nginx, Packer, and Ansible roles.
- **Tools**:
  - Packer validate for templates.
  - Ansible Molecule for role testing.
  - Python testing frameworks (e.g., Pytest for scripts).
- **Frequency**: Run on every code commit via CI pipeline.
- **Goal**: Validate configurations and logic without external dependencies.

---

### **Integration Testing**
- **Scope**: Test interaction between components like Nginx with Squid or Terraform modules with Ansible-provisioned infrastructure.
- **Environment**: Use isolated environments mimicking production with mocked external systems.
- **Tools**:
  - Terraform validate and plan for infrastructure configurations.
  - Test Kitchen for combined Ansible and Terraform validation.
- **Frequency**: Triggered after unit tests pass and before QA deployment.
- **Goal**: Ensure interoperability and adherence to platform standards.

---

### **Smoke Testing**
- **Scope**: Validate basic functionality of shared services after deployment in staging.
  - **Example**: Nginx responding to health checks, Squid proxy functionality.
- **Tools**:
  - Custom scripts for health checks.
  - Lightweight probes (e.g., curl or HTTP checks) integrated into CI/CD pipelines.
- **Frequency**: Post-deployment in any non-production environment.
- **Goal**: Quick assurance that the deployment is viable for further testing.

---

### **End-to-End (E2E) Testing**
- **Scope**: Simulate real-world use cases involving all components of the cloud access suite.
  - **Example**: User access requests routed through Squid and Nginx with end-to-end TLS termination.
- **Environment**: Full staging environment with production parity.
- **Tools**:
  - Selenium or Postman for API testing.
  - Terraform Cloud for validating end-to-end infrastructure states.
  - External compliance validation tools (where applicable).
- **Frequency**: Prior to stakeholder review and production release.
- **Goal**: Validate the complete user journey, security, and compliance requirements.

---

### **General Practices**
- **Automate Everything**: Integrate all tests into CI/CD pipelines with automated triggers.
- **Compliance Checks**: Embed regulatory and security validations into testing (e.g., static analysis, vulnerability scans).
- **Testing Stages**:
  1. **Pre-Commit**: Unit tests.
  2. **Post-Commit**: Integration and smoke tests.
  3. **Pre-Release**: E2E tests and stakeholder reviews.

## Technology-Specific Testing Strategy

### **Python → Ansible → Terraform**

---

### **1. Unit Testing**

- **Python**: Use **Pytest** to isolate and validate functions or classes.
  - **Example**: Test a Python script that dynamically generates Squid ACLs by validating input formats (e.g., IP address validation) and correct ACL file generation. Mock file I/O and external dependencies.
  - **Command**: `pytest --cov=my_script tests/unit/test_acl_generator.py`

- **Ansible**: Use **Molecule** with a driver like Docker or Podman to test individual roles.
  - **Example**: Test the `squid_proxy` role by asserting the correct configuration file is rendered in `/etc/squid/squid.conf` and ensures idempotency on repeated runs.
  - **Command**: `molecule test -s default`

- **Terraform**: Use **Terratest** to validate single modules in isolation.
  - **Example**: Test a `network_security_group` module to confirm only specific ports (e.g., 80, 443) are open and validate output variables.
  - **Code Snippet**:
    ```go
    func TestSecurityGroup(t *testing.T) {
        options := terraform.WithDefaultRetryableErrors(t, &terraform.Options{
            TerraformDir: "../modules/network_security_group",
        })
        defer terraform.Destroy(t, options)
        terraform.InitAndApply(t, options)
        securityGroupID := terraform.Output(t, options, "security_group_id")
        assert.NotEmpty(t, securityGroupID)
    }
    ```


### **2. Integration Testing**

- **Python**: Use **Pytest** with mock frameworks like `pytest-mock` to simulate interactions between components.
  - **Example**: Test a script that interfaces with the AWS API to dynamically update DNS records by mocking the `boto3` client and asserting correct API calls.
  - **Command**: `pytest tests/integration/test_dns_updater.py`

- **Ansible**: Use **Molecule** with a cloud driver (e.g., EC2) to test interactions between multiple roles.
  - **Example**: Validate an `nginx` role integrates with a `squid_proxy` role to ensure upstream proxies are correctly defined in `/etc/nginx/conf.d/proxy.conf`.
  - **Command**: `molecule test -s ec2_integration`

- **Terraform**: Use **Terratest** to deploy dependent modules and validate interactions.
  - **Example**: Deploy a VPC module and verify it integrates with a subnet module by confirming routes and security group rules are correctly applied.
  - **Code Snippet**:
    ```go
    func TestVpcWithSubnets(t *testing.T) {
        options := &terraform.Options{
            TerraformDir: "../modules/vpc_with_subnets",
        }
        defer terraform.Destroy(t, options)
        terraform.InitAndApply(t, options)
        vpcID := terraform.Output(t, options, "vpc_id")
        subnetIDs := terraform.OutputList(t, options, "subnet_ids")
        assert.NotEmpty(t, vpcID)
        assert.Equal(t, 3, len(subnetIDs)) // Example: Expecting 3 subnets
    }
    ```

---

### **3. Smoke Testing**

- **Python**: Execute lightweight scripts in a staging environment to ensure basic functionality.
  - **Example**: Run a script that applies proxy configuration updates and validate output logs for success.
  - **Command**: `python update_proxy_config.py --test`

- **Ansible**: Run playbooks to validate essential service availability.
  - **Example**: Deploy the `nginx` role and confirm it serves a default webpage on port 80 using `curl` and returns a 200 HTTP status code.
  - **Command**: `ansible-playbook -i staging inventory.yml nginx.yml && curl -I http://localhost`

- **Terraform**: Deploy critical resources and validate their basic availability.
  - **Example**: Deploy a single EC2 instance and confirm SSH connectivity using its output public IP.
  - **Code Snippet**:
    ```go
    func TestInstanceConnectivity(t *testing.T) {
        options := &terraform.Options{TerraformDir: "../modules/ec2_instance"}
        defer terraform.Destroy(t, options)
        terraform.InitAndApply(t, options)
        publicIP := terraform.Output(t, options, "instance_public_ip")
        assert.NotEmpty(t, publicIP)
        ssh.CheckSshCommandE(t, ssh.Host{Hostname: publicIP, User: "ubuntu"}, "echo hello")
    }
    ```

---

### **4. End-to-End (E2E) Testing**

- **Python**: Use **Selenium** or **Postman** to validate full workflows involving Python automation.
  - **Example**: Test a Python service that provisions proxy rules by simulating a user request, invoking the service, and verifying proxy behavior end-to-end.
  - **Command**: `pytest tests/e2e/test_proxy_provisioning.py`

- **Ansible**: Execute end-to-end playbooks in a production-like staging environment.
  - **Example**: Deploy an end-to-end stack with Squid and Nginx configured for a user authentication flow and verify end-to-end TLS termination.
  - **Command**: `ansible-playbook -i staging full_stack.yml && curl -k --cert test.crt https://proxy.local`

- **Terraform**: Deploy a complete environment and validate user workflows.
  - **Example**: Deploy a public cloud setup (VPC, subnets, EC2, and load balancer) and verify a web service is accessible through the load balancer with proper security configurations.
  - **Code Snippet**:
    ```go
    func TestFullEnvironment(t *testing.T) {
        options := &terraform.Options{TerraformDir: "../modules/full_environment"}
        defer terraform.Destroy(t, options)
        terraform.InitAndApply(t, options)
        lbDNS := terraform.Output(t, options, "load_balancer_dns")
        assert.NotEmpty(t, lbDNS)
        http_helper.HttpGetWithRetry(t, "http://"+lbDNS, nil, 200, "Welcome", 10, 5*time.Second)
    }
    ```
