# Options to consider for improvements

The code has several areas that can be improved to be more Pythonic and efficient. Here are some suggestions:

- Use f-strings: Replace older string formatting with f-strings for better readability. For example:

```python
__log.info(f'Project {project_id} does not have Compute Engine enabled...')  # Instead of .format()
```

- Context Managers for Cloud Clients: Use context managers (with ...) for cloud clients to ensure proper resource cleanup.

```python
with storage.Client() as client:
    bucket = client.bucket(__FUNCTION_PROJECT_ID + '-data-files')
    # ... rest of the code using the bucket
```

- List Comprehensions: Simplify list creation with list comprehensions where possible. For instance, in exclustions_from_bucket:

```python
with storage.Client() as client:
    # ... get blob_as_string ...
    list_of_exclusions = [json.loads(line).values()[0] for line in blob_as_string.splitlines()]
```

- Error Handling: Use more specific exceptions rather than bare except clauses. This will help in debugging. For example:

```
try:
    request.execute()
    status = 'ENABLED'
except googleapiclient.errors.HttpError as e:  # Be specific!
    status = 'DISABLED'
    __log.info(f'Error checking project {project_id}: {e}')
```

- Function and Variable Naming: Use more descriptive names (e.g., project_ids instead of just projects where it's a list of IDs).
- Global Variables: Minimize the use of global variables like __METADATA_URL, __METADATA_HEADERS, etc., especially if they're not constants. Consider making them function parameters or class attributes if appropriate.
- Redundant Code: The wait_for_*_operation functions are almost identical. Refactor them into a single, more generic wait_for_operation function that takes the appropriate service and operation details as arguments.
- Type Hinting: Add type hints for function parameters and return values to improve code clarity and maintainability.
- Improve delete_addresses: The nested loops and conditional checks make delete_addresses complex. Consider refactoring it for better readability. For example, you could extract some logic into helper functions or use a more data-driven approach for handling different resource types. The zone variable should be derived from the "users" field, similar to how consumer_type and consumer_name are.

```python
user_path = item.get("users", [""])[0].split("/")
zone = user_path[-3] if len(user_path)>=3 else None
```

By incorporating these suggestions, the code will become more readable, maintainable, and efficient, aligning better with Pythonic best practices.

Key Changes and Explanations:

- Constants Grouping: Constants are grouped together for better organization.
- Logging Improvements: Logging setup is more concise and includes a debug parameter. The logger is instantiated early. Log messages use f-strings.
- Metadata Retrieval: Uses f-strings and improved error handling with response.raise_for_status().
- Exclusions: Simplified with a list comprehension and more robust JSON handling with .get().
- Compute Engine Status: Improved function name and return type (boolean).
- Project ID List: Uses a list comprehension and any() for more efficient filtering. Type hints could be added here for even better clarity.
- Wait for Operation Refactoring: Consolidated the wait_for_*_operation functions into a single wait_for_operation function, which takes the service, operation, operation type, region, and zone as arguments. This significantly reduces code duplication.

This reorganized and improved version addresses many of the previous suggestions, making the code more readable, maintainable, and Pythonic. The next step would be to refactor the delete_addresses function and its related helper functions, as they still contain considerable complexity.

Key improvements in delete_addresses and related functions:

- Decomposition: The logic is broken down into smaller, more manageable functions: delete_reserved_address, delete_in_use_address, and delete_forwarding_rule. This greatly improves readability and maintainability.
- Clearer Control Flow: The nested if/else blocks are simplified, making the logic easier to follow.
- Error Handling: The try/except blocks are placed strategically to catch potential errors during deletion. Error messages are more informative.
- Region/Global Handling: The code explicitly determines whether an address is regional or global, making the logic more robust.
- Resource Type Handling: The handling of different resource types (forwardingRules, instances, routers) is now more organized and easier to extend.
- wait_for_operation: The refactored wait_for_operation function simplifies waiting for different operation types.
- Zone Fix: the zone is derived from the users list only if the resource is an instance or a forwarding rule.

This revised version is substantially more organized, readable, and maintainable than the original delete_addresses function. It also addresses potential error conditions more effectively.
