# 🚀 Lead Platform Engineer — Kubernetes | GCP | GitOps | Banking Innovation

**Location:** Hybrid / Remote (UK/EU timezones preferred)  
**Level:** Principal / Staff Engineer  
**Type:** Full-time, Permanent

---

Join us on a mission to **redefine how platforms are built and operated in regulated financial environments**.

We’re building a **next-generation internal developer platform** for a major bank — but not just any platform. This is a **GitOps-first, Kubernetes-native, controller-driven ecosystem** that puts **developer experience, scalability, and enterprise-grade governance** at the core.

As our **Lead Platform Engineer**, you’ll take the helm of our Kubernetes architecture, shaping and driving the platform that empowers teams across the bank to ship, scale, and operate software with unprecedented autonomy and compliance. This is your chance to lead the charge on a **true Platform-as-Product** initiative, with meaningful impact and technical freedom.

## 💼 What You’ll Be Doing

- **Own and evolve our Kubernetes foundation** – architecting, deploying, and scaling clusters that run mission-critical workloads.
- Design and implement a **controller-based model** for self-service capabilities — think CRDs and operators that encapsulate complex banking controls.
- Leverage (or learn) **Kubernetes Config Connector (KCC)** to orchestrate Google Cloud Platform (GCP) infrastructure declaratively, integrating cloud provisioning into the Kubernetes control plane.
- Champion **GitOps principles** across the platform — declarative everything, automated everywhere.
- Collaborate with security, compliance, and risk teams to **bake enterprise governance directly into the platform** — balancing agility with control.
- Mentor engineers, shape best practices, and help define our internal platform engineering culture.

## 🌟 What Makes This Role Special

- **Build a platform for engineers, by engineers** — we prioritize DX, automation, and extensibility.
- Work with **cutting-edge cloud-native tech**: K8s controllers, Flux/CD, KCC, GCP, Policy-as-Code, and more.
- Operate in a **forward-thinking banking environment** where innovation is championed and platform engineering is first-class.
- Have real impact on **engineering velocity and regulatory confidence** at scale — this is high-trust, high-responsibility work.
- **Lead, not just implement** — you’ll shape architectural direction, tooling strategy, and team culture.

## 🔍 What We’re Looking For

- **Deep Kubernetes expertise** — you understand it inside and out: networking, scheduling, operators, RBAC, controllers, the works.
- Hands-on experience with **cloud infrastructure (GCP preferred)** — or strong interest in learning KCC to bring GCP infra into the K8s paradigm.
- Experience with or strong knowledge of **GitOps tooling and practices** (e.g., ArgoCD, Flux).
- Solid background in **infrastructure as code**, automation, and CI/CD pipelines.
- Ability to **design and build internal platforms** that balance usability with enterprise controls.
- A **system thinker and strong communicator** — able to navigate complexity and lead technical conversations with engineers, architects, and stakeholders.

---

## ✨ Bonus Points For

- Experience building **custom Kubernetes controllers** or operators.
- Familiarity with **Policy-as-Code** tools like OPA/Gatekeeper or Kyverno.
- Exposure to **regulated environments** — banking, healthcare, etc.
- Passion for **developer productivity and platform-as-product** thinking.

## 👥 Who You’ll Work With

You’ll be part of a **tight-knit, senior engineering team** building the platform from the ground up, collaborating with product managers, SREs, compliance experts, and internal customers. You’ll have the autonomy to lead and the backing to make bold decisions.
