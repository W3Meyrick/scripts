# Development Process and Testing Strategy Summary

## Development Process for a Cloud Platform Team

### **1. Development/In Progress**
- Developers work on prioritized tasks using feature branches.
- Write and run unit tests while adhering to coding standards.
- Ensure code compiles, passes tests, and completes self-review.

### **2. Development Review**
- Code is peer-reviewed for standards, functionality, and security.
- Defined criteria include cleanliness, maintainability, and test coverage.
- Approval requires all feedback to be addressed and tests passing.

### **3. Quality Assurance (QA)**
- Validate functionality and performance in a controlled environment.
- QA team runs functional, integration, and regression tests.
- Exit only if all test cases pass and critical defects are resolved.

### **4. Ready to Merge**
- Conduct final reviews and validate with integration tests.
- Confirm deployment success in a staging environment.
- Merge code into the main branch for deployment readiness.

### **5. Stakeholder Review**
- Present a demo in a staging or pre-production environment.
- Incorporate stakeholder feedback into the feature or release.
- Achieve final stakeholder sign-off before production.

## Testing Strategy for a Cloud Platform Team in a Regulated Bank

### **Unit Testing**
- Validate individual components like Packer, Ansible, and Python scripts.
- Use Packer validate, Molecule, and Pytest for technology-specific checks.
- Automate tests via CI to ensure isolated logic works as expected.

### **Integration Testing**
- Test component interoperability in isolated staging environments.
- Combine Terraform, Ansible, and scripts with tools like Terratest and Test Kitchen.
- Focus on ensuring seamless interaction and adherence to standards.

### **Smoke Testing**
- Verify critical functionality post-deployment (e.g., Nginx and Squid health checks).
- Use lightweight tests like curl, logs, and connectivity probes.
- Quickly confirm deployment viability for further testing.

### **End-to-End (E2E) Testing**
- Simulate real-world workflows, including user access through Squid and Nginx.
- Deploy production-parity environments for validation.
- Use Selenium or Postman to ensure compliance and complete functionality.

## Technology-Specific Testing Strategy (Python → Ansible → Terraform)

### **Unit Testing**
- **Python**: Use Pytest to test individual functions (e.g., ACL file generation).
- **Ansible**: Molecule validates roles like Nginx and Squid in isolation.
- **Terraform**: Terratest verifies correctness of modules like security groups.

### **Integration Testing**
- **Python**: Mock external dependencies to test API integration logic.
- **Ansible**: Combine roles (e.g., Squid + Nginx) and validate via Molecule.
- **Terraform**: Deploy dependent modules (e.g., VPC + subnets) to confirm interaction.

### **Smoke Testing**
- **Python**: Run scripts to confirm output integrity and logging.
- **Ansible**: Deploy roles and validate basic service availability (e.g., curl checks).
- **Terraform**: Deploy minimal resources and validate outputs like public IPs.

### **End-to-End Testing**
- **Python**: Simulate workflows with Postman or Selenium.
- **Ansible**: Execute complete playbooks for stack deployment.
- **Terraform**: Deploy full environments and validate resources end-to-end.

## Technology-Specific Testing Strategy (GCP Focus)

### **Unit Testing**
- **Python**: Mock `google-cloud` libraries to test scripts like DNS updates.
- **Ansible**: Molecule validates GCP-specific roles like Compute Engine instances.
- **Terraform**: Terratest ensures correctness of modules like GCP firewalls.

### **Integration Testing**
- Validate multi-service dependencies (e.g., Compute + DNS).
- Use Molecule with GCP drivers to verify roles like Nginx deployment.
- Deploy interdependent Terraform modules (e.g., VPC + GKE cluster).

### **Smoke Testing**
- Run scripts and basic playbooks to validate core functionality.
- Test Nginx service availability on Compute Engine instances.
- Confirm Terraform-deployed resources like instance connectivity.

### **End-to-End Testing**
- Simulate end-user workflows, including full stack deployments.
- Deploy environments with Terraform and verify services (e.g., GCP Load Balancer).
- Use Ansible playbooks to validate configuration and service behavior.
