## Slide 3: Technical Expertise and Problem-Solving Approach

### "Problem Solving Through Technical Expertise"

- **Example Problem: High Latency in Payment Processing System**
  - **Challenge**: Significant latency issues during peak transaction times, impacting customer experience and system performance.
  - **Approach**: Utilized distributed tracing and observability tools (e.g., Prometheus and Grafana) to isolate bottlenecks. Identified that a specific microservice handling transaction routing was causing delays.
  - **Solution**: Refactored the microservice, optimized database calls, and added caching layers to reduce load.
  - **Impact**: Reduced latency by 50% and improved transaction throughput by 20%, enhancing the reliability of a critical customer-facing system.

## Slide 4: Driving SRE Culture and Best Practices

### "Fostering an SRE Culture of Reliability and Collaboration"

- **Cultural Contributions**:
  - Introduced a "blameless post-mortem" practice for incident reviews, promoting a collaborative approach to problem-solving and continuous improvement.
  - Advocated for the adoption of infrastructure as code (IaC) using Terraform, which has streamlined deployments and improved team accountability and consistency.
- **Key Initiative: Chaos Engineering for Resilience Testing**
  - Implemented regular chaos testing on core systems to simulate failures and ensure systems perform under stress.
  - **Impact**: Increased system resilience, reducing potential downtime by preparing the team and infrastructure for unexpected incidents.
- **Tools**: Promoted the use of monitoring and observability tools like Grafana, Prometheus, and Kibana to standardize visibility across services and improve proactive detection.
